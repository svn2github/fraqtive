<p>The <b>Calculation Depth</b> slider controls how many iterations are calculated before filling a point with the background color. The number of iterations is automatically adjusted when changing the zoom level.</p>

<p>The <b>Detal Level</b> slider controls how much details of the fractal are calculated. Parts containing few details are skipped for faster generation.</p>

<p>The <b>Anti-Aliasing</b> option controls the post-processing level of the image which makes it look more smooth in areas containing much details.</p>
