<h1>Quick Guide to Fraqtive</h1>

<p>This guide will help you quickly start working with Fraqtive. You can still use the application while this window is open. You can open this guide later by clicking the <b><img src="../icons/about-16.png"/> About Fraqtive</b> icon or pressing F1.</p>

<p>The main window of Fraqtive consists of a tool strip on the top, a fractal view which takes most of the window, a properties panel and a Julia preview panel. You can undock both panels and move them to another position. You can use the properties panel to view and modify all parameters of the fractal, color settings, advanced settings and animation settings.</p>
