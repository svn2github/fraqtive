<h1>Generating Images</h1>

<p>You can save the currently displayed image using the <b>File &gt; <img src="../icons/save-16.png"/> Save Image</b> command. This works both in 2D and 3D modes. The PNG, JPEG, BMP and PPM image formats are supported. You can also copy the current image to clipboard using the <b>Edit &gt; <img src="../icons/copy-16.png"/> Copy Image</b> command.</p>

<p>To quickly generate an image with the size of your screen (which is useful for creating wallpapers) you can enable the full screen mode and press <b>Ctrl+S</b> to save the current image.</p>

<p>Use the <b>File &gt; <img src="../icons/generate-image-16.png"/> Generate Image</b> command to generate an image of an arbitrary size, up to 8000 x 8000 pixels in the 32-bit version or up to 30720 x 17280 pixels in the 64-bit version. You can specify different advanced settings than the ones used in the main window, so you can use this function to generate high quality images and use fast settings while navigating.</p>

<p>Use the <b>File &gt; <img src="../icons/generate-series-16.png"/> Generate Series</b> command to generate a series of images with increasing zoom level. You can specify the number of images to generate, the difference between the zoom level in the first and last image and an optional rotation angle. The <b>Blending</b> option reduces flickering by blending consecutive images together with the specified factor, which is useful if the images are used to create an animation.</p>
