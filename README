Mandelbrot family fractal generator.

Fraqtive is an open source, multi-platform generator of the Mandelbrot
family fractals. It uses very fast algorithms supporting SSE2
and multi-core processors. It generates high quality anti-aliased
images and renders 3D scenes using OpenGL. It allows real-time
navigation and dynamic generation of the Julia fractal preview.
