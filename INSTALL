Requirements
============

Requirements:

 * Qt 4.6 or newer (http://qt-project.org/)

The program can be built using the standard 'qmake' tool from Qt. Simple configure
scripts are available for both Linux and Windows which create a configuration file
and run qmake with appropriate parameters. See detailed instructions below.


Linux
=====

To compile the program you will need a C++ compiler (preferably gcc) and headers
for the Qt library (if you use binary packages, make sure you have the appropriate
'devel' package installed).

The typical procedure of building and installing the program is:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Additional options that can be passed to the configure script:

    -prefix DIR

        Location where the package will be installed (default is '/usr/local').

    -qmake PATH

        Full path to the 'qmake' tool (required if it cannot be found
        automatically).

    -debug

        Build with debugging symbols.

    -no-sse2
    
        Compile without using SSE2 instructions (by default SSE2 is enabled).


Windows
=======

You must have the open source edition of Qt installed. The program can be compiled
using either the MinGW compiler or Microsoft Visual C++.

If you are using MinGW, open the Qt Command Prompt. Go to the directory where
you have unpacked Fraqtive and run:

    > configure.bat
    > mingw32-make

If you are using Microsoft Visual C++, open the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
Make sure that QTDIR is set to the path where Qt was installed. Go to the directory
where you have unpacked Fraqtive and run:

    > set QTDIR=C:\path\to\qt
    > configure.bat
    > nmake

Additional options that can be passed to the configure script:

    -prefix DIR

        The location where the package will be installed (default is
        'C:\Program Files\Fraqtive').

    -debug

        Build with debugging symbols.

    -no-sse2
    
        Compile without using SSE2 instructions (by default SSE2 is enabled
        except on MinGW where it's buggy).

    -msvc

        Generate a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio instead of Makefiles.
